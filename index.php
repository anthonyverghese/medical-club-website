<h3 class="left">MEDICINE + PHILANTHROPY </h3>
<p class="justify center whiteline">CAMP, or Cornell Association of Medicine and Philanthropy, is a STEM and
           Pre-health focused organization on campus.  Our purpose is to
           broaden perspectives on areas of medical work other than a single
           pre-medical purpose as well as to raise awareness and give back
           through philanthropic events to underrepresented causes.
           We admit all students who demonstrate a genuine interest in the
           organization with our purpose and support and encourage all STEM
          studentsâ€™ interests. CAMP has weekly meetings for members of Wednesdays
          from 5-6 in Malott 203 or Goldwin Smith Hall G64 on Cornell's campus. Explore our
           website to see how you can get involved!</p>

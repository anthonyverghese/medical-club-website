# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. The team contract is a *living* document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own. These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should include these elements. Feel free to add other terms, too.**

1. Team name or project name. Plus full name and NetID of each of your team members.

White Moose
 * Dan Madrid (DEM283)
 * Anthony Verghese (AKV26)
 * Justin Tran (JTT65)
 * Kamille Gomez (KKG34)

2. To what goals do we all commit?

Our main goal is to create an inclusive environment where we all feel comfortable asking each other questions and voicing our opinions. We hope that by accomplishing this goal we create a learning environment that maximizes what we get out of this project. We hope to teach one another our strengths. Our secondary goal is to communicate efficiently with the client in a way that creates a positive relationship. We want to make sure that they remain happy with working with us without overloading ourselves with unreasonable requests. We want to maintain a balance between their demands and what is physically possible for us to accomplish in the project time period. Overall we want to have a fun experience that also maximizes our learning.

3. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)

  * **Communicate effectively with team members:** Make sure to routinely check text messages to ensure not missing the communication efforts of other team members. If you know you will be unable to check your messages for a prolonged period of time and a deadline is approaching, let your team mates know the time period you will be unable to communicate. If any problems or conflicts arise notify team members immediately.
  * **Respect the time of others:** Ensure that you arrive on time to all meetings and use the time during those meetings to work efficiently. When at meetings do not work on other work for classes. Understand that we are all busy students and communicate right away when you have time conflicts that could prevent you from coming to a meeting.
  * **Work towards deadlines efficiently:** Do not wait for the last minute to complete work. Work ahead of time to ensure that if a conflict arises we can work together to fix it. Submit all assignments on time.

4. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

We will meet in person every Thursday, starting at 6pm and working till about 8pm. We will meet in Upson or Gates depending on room availability. We will communicate continuously via text message group. We will expect that team members will check their phone at least once per day.

5. How will we communicate and work with our client?

We will communicate with the client via email. We will also set up a google drive for them to upload content for us. We will constantly provide the client with updates.

6. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for.

* **Dan Madrid:** Dan is the team lead. This means he is in charge of making sure the team is making each deadline in an efficient manner. He is in charge of making sure the team stays on track and is properly communicating.
* **Anthony Verghese:** Anthony is the client lead. He is in charge of communicating with the client and ensuring that the team is keeping the target audience of the client in mind at all time and ensuring that the team is keeping in mind what the client wants.
* **Kamille Gomez:** Kamille will work as the design lead. This role means that she will be in charge of making sure there is a coherent design being created by the team members. She will have the final say in arguments about design aspects where the team members are split.
* **Justin Tran:** Justin is the programming lead. This role means that he is in charge of making sure that after combining all of the team members code together, that the overall code meets coding standards.
* All team members will work evenly on all aspects of the project, including designing and programming.


7. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

* We will hold each other accountable through constant communication and discussions. We will set internal deadlines that everyone must be meet. Through these internal deadlines, we will ensure that we distribute the work evenly.
* If a team member fails to deliver what was expected, after the first time we will discuss their performance in a team meeting. We will ask why they did not deliver what was expected and offer help to prevent the situation from happening again. However, if the team member does not deliver what was promised multiple times we will arrange a meeting with professor harms or a TA to discuss the problem.

8. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

In the case of a disagreement we will have a team vote. The majority vote will be the winner. In the case of a tie, the programmer lead or the designer lead will decide what to do, depending on whether it is a code issue or design issue. If disagreement still continues, we will go to a TA and ask for advice. After talking to the TA we will reevaluate and use their advice to decide. If the argument still continues then, we will flip a coin.

9. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

We will re-visit this contract if problems continue to exist. The team lead will be in charge of identifying these problems and leading a discussion in which we review the problems and edit the contract.

10. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)

We will get bubble tea to celebrate milestone completions!

## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract. If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your issue using the contract, you may reach out to the instructor via the <info2300-prof@cornell.edu> email. Be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?"

<h3 class="center">ABOUT CAMP</h3>
<p class="justify center">Cornell Association of Medicine and Philanthropy (CAMP) was founded in summer of 2015 by president Zhun Che. CAMP was established to provide pre-health students opportunities to participate in humanitarian aid and philanthropy projects, to build a strong network with other pre- health students, and to receive academic and professional support to advance oneâ€™s development as a future healthcare provider. Since its beginning, CAMP has been a partner of Action Against Hunger, a non- profit humanitarian organization that promotes awareness on issues of malnutrition in developing parts of the world and provides aid to such areas of need. CAMP has pledged its support for Action Against Hunger through its annual Hunger Awareness Week, consisting of photo campaigns that are hosted on the Action Against Hunger website and fundraisers with proceeds going to Action Against Hunger. In addition, CAMP hosts an annual Action Against Hunger Benefit Gala in partnership with Action Against Hunger as well as other organizations on-campus. CAMP strives to foster passion for service, leadership, and dedication in its members through host of philanthropy and academic support events throughout the year. CAMP hosts philanthropy events related to health and medicine that are planned and executed by small sub-group of members every month, establishing itself as the organization most dedicated to service.<p>
